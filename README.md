# SheCodes Plus Workshop 
This repository contains exercises I completed for the SheCodes Plus workshop, a self-paced online coding workshop designed for beginners. 

Key skills I acquired during the workshop include:
* Proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Familiarity with tools like VSCode, API usage, GitHub, and web hosting
* Application of advanced JavaScript techniques (ES6) for building an interactive weather forecast application
* Integration of a live API to dynamically fetch and display current weather data.
